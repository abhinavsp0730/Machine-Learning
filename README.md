# Machine Learning

This is a repository consisting of the code written while learning and implementing machine learning concepts and algorithms.
It consists of algorithms from supervised, unsupervised and deep learning. We use Sklearn, Keras and Tensorflow during this time.

The following algorithms are implemented and used in this repository:

```
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forests
5. KNN
6. SVM
7. Neural Networks
8. CNN
```

The following is the list of folders to go through in order to have a logical order of things:

## Google colab 
In this repository we'll suggest you practise Machine Learning in 
google colab.
Why google colab?
Google colab provides free GPU. This means our machine learning 
model will train fast.
